Monte Carlo Simulation for Blackjack game

I implemented a simple Blackjack game in this project. It uses the basic rules of Blackjack and
only two players participate in the game, a player and a dealer. I have a deck where I get the
cards from. The deck is an arraylist where I put all the cards. Arraylist is the main data structure
in this project. It is very useful as cards can be added to the arraylist and removed when
necessary.
One of the main purposes of this project is to understand how to create classes and make the
interaction between them, so that we can write codes in a class and can call them from other
classes. This helps to keep the program concise and makes it a nice one. Apart from this, it has
an extensive use of for, while, if/else loops, that helps me to improve my knowledge on these
topics.
After that, we use the simulation class as we play a large number of games. From the results
shown below, we observe that the number of player wins and the number of dealer wins are close
to each other. We see that the house (dealer) doesn’t always win, but it has a greater percentage
of winning. So, the saying “The house always wins” is proven to be true.
